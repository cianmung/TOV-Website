                <p><em>If you have met one person with dementia, you have only met one person. Each individual will talk,
                    act, remember
                    and behave differently, not simply because of what stage of dementia they are in, but because of who
                    they are.</em></p>

                <img src="./images/thinkp_dimentia1.png" width="100%" alt="Dementia1">

                <p> Dementia does not dent the human desire for a normal and dignified life, nor should it reduce
                    anyone’s rights as
                    unique social beings deserving of inclusion, respect and trust. Singapore is emerging as a key node
                    in what is a
                    global epidemic of dementia that primarily affects seniors. The Open Vault at OCBC (TOV) has taken
                    steps to
                    support community partners helping those living with this condition – and their families.</p>
                <p><strong> In its approach to helping customers with pain points beyond banking, TOV takes the admirable
                    approach of first
                    removing the ‘banker hat’ and focusing on understanding the underlying problems customers face.
                    Sometimes it is
                    a result of inefficiencies in the industry, entrenched or traditional business models that have not
                    been changed,
                    or neglected and underserved customer needs.</strong></p>
                <p> “The growing cost of Healthcare is a problem that will affect individuals and families living in
                    Singapore.
                    Healthcare financing and coverage underpins this, but transparency and access to information for
                    individuals
                    to make better decisions on their health is important. Only by putting ourselves in the shoes of the
                    customer,
                    can we identify and co-develop solutions with our partners.” said Ryan Lou, Vice President of
                    Partnerships &
                    New Ventures, Fintech & Innovation Group at The Open Vault at OCBC.</p>
                <p>“We know that to develop breakthrough solutions that are out-of-the-box, we need to look
                    out-of-the-bank.
                    Our goal is to make banking more rewarding for customers and we do that by playing a part in other
                    aspects
                    of the customer’s everyday lives, one of which is their health and well-being. Though they interact
                    with us
                    as their financial institution, we know their needs span a broader spectrum.”</p>
                <p> In July, TOV supported <a

                        target="_blank">Designathon We Engage 2019</a>, a hackathon that brought members of the
                    community together
                    to collaborate and identify design solutions for persons with dementia and their caregivers. A core
                    theme for
                    this year’s Designathon is how to keep persons living with dementia engaged, with an emphasis on
                    sound and hearing
                    to evoke memories and trigger positive emotions. Mr Lou joined the likes of Ms Theresa Lee, Deputy
                    Chief Executive
                    Officer at the Alzheimer’s Disease Association, Ms Lee Lee Sian, Senior Occupational Therapist,
                    Woodlands Integrated
                    Health Campus and Mr Rishi Gupta Co-Founder of Silver Activities as part of the panel of judges for
                    the
                    dementia-focused section.</p>
                <p> The prizes for the dementia-focused designathon was given out by Speaker of Parliament, Tan Chuan
                    Jin.</p>
                <p> In preparation for this year’s <a
                        href="https://www.designsingapore.org/modules/events/enabling-festival-2019" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        target="_blank">Enabling Festival</a>, TOV sought to engage closely with community partners,
                    and help the participants take their ideas closer to commercialization. The Designathon, focused on
                    potential
                    solutions not only for those diagnosed with dementia now, but also those showing symptoms (e.g.
                    problems with
                    recent memory, commonly misplacing objects and facing difficulty in communicating with others). The
                    projects
                    that stood out were those that arrested the deterioration the condition causes by engagement.</p>
                <div id="Dementia2"style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                    <img src="./images/thinkp_dementia2.png" alt="Dementia2"></div>
                <p> The hackathon saw many great ideas contributed by the broader community and those living with
                    Dementia. From
                    students to retirees, the participants proposed impressively creative solutions from various
                    perspectives, shedding
                    light on how a spectrum of problems and solutions for different focus groups can be addressed.</p>
                <p> For example, a group of students developed a soft toy plushie for patients to help trigger reminders
                    for patients,
                    such as taking their medication or to simply take a walk. On a more tech-focused front, one idea
                    enabled family members
                    to record phrases that can be played back to more severe dementia patients that ask for their loved
                    ones every day. This
                    helps simulate a “conversation” between them and their family. Solutions catered for patients’
                    families were also created,
                    such as an educational booklet for young children to help build their understanding of dementia and
                    what their elderly
                    relatives are going through.</p>

                         style="margin-right: 10px;">
                    <br>
                    <strong>“Solving pain points beyond banking requires us to work with new partners and learn from the
                        perspectives of different people in the industry.</strong>
                    Sitting on the judging panel with industry experts from the Alzheimer’s Disease Association,
                    Woodlands Integrated Health Campus, was an eye opening experience that helped us hone and identify
                    the biggest challenges,” said Mr Ryan Lou. “We want to create meaningful partnerships that can bring
                    to life practical community solutions that empower individuals and their families to enjoy their
                    lives outside the disease.”</p>
                
                <p> Diagnosing, treating, and managing dementia brings many challenges. There is extra emotional
                    pressure on family members
                    who are also their loved ones’ caregivers, and financial obligations for family members who hire
                    external caregivers.
                    The post-hospitalisation and post-treatment journey is equally important, if not more, than the
                    treatment itself.</p>
                <p> We have a world-class healthcare system, but it will be tested by the growing ageing population and
                    rise of early onset
                    chronic disease. Banks need to go beyond banking and plug into these growing social needs to do
                    better for our customers.
                    Dementia does not only affect the individual, but their families, support systems and society as a
                    whole, and banks need
                    to be prepared to be there every step of the journey.</p>

                <h2>
                    The texting generation</h2>

                <p>A 2017 Salesforce study pointed to a much higher percentage of millennials (44 percent) who prefer to
                    communicate
                    with advisors via text messages. This does not seem like a tall order.</p>
                <p>After all, this ‘texting generation’ has a strong affinity for eschewing tactile face-to-face or
                    ‘voice-to-voice’
                    communication for a minimized mode of interaction. Whilst brands are pushing for the development of
                    natural language
                    processing (NLP) to produce bots with sophisticated chat abilities, artificial intelligence (AI)
                    enables the
                    technology to take it a step further by making the chatbot a reliable resource and aggregator of
                    information
                    on-demand. And in turn, transforming a pivotal point in the customer decision journey.</p>
                <h2>
                    Chatbots in the world of banking and finance</h2>

                <p>In the banking world, the conversation around chatbots takes on an added layer of complexity with the
                    intricate
                    process of balancing compliance with communication for client advice. The integral part of
                    effectively addressing
                    client inquiries is not simply to inform, but also to disclose – material information that the
                    client is entitled
                    to and should be aware of.</p>
                <p>From an operational standpoint, AI-powered communications can help to eliminate basic human errors
                    like the omission
                    or inconsistent presentation of critical information. For most transactional communications, a
                    single chatbot
                    inquiry is estimated to save up to four minutes in call duration compared with traditional call
                    center inquiries,
                    according to a recent report by Juniper Research.</p>
                <p>It is no wonder that the research house found that chatbots are expected to create over US$8 billion
                    per year in
                    cost savings for global banks by 2022!</p>
                <p>The Open Vault and our Consumer Secured Lending team saw this opportunity. In April 2017, launched
                    'Emma' – our
                    first chatbot and AI-powered home and renovation loan specialist at OCBC Bank. Through a prompted
                    conversation
                    with customers, 'Emma' collects data that will help to compute their affordability via an in-built
                    total debt
                    servicing ratio (TDSR) calculator. This approach 'Emma' complements the service provided by our
                    frontline staff,
                    by answering basic queries around the clock so that they can focus on customer engagement. In a
                    click, cold leads
                    turn into pre-qualified leads for mortgage specialists to follow up on. By handling simultaneous
                    interactions
                    anywhere the bot has increased the scalability of our business and will allow us to expand beyond
                    our current
                    suite of products in the future.</p>
                <h2>A little less conversation, a little more action,
                    please</h2>

                <h3 class="quote">
                    With the further development of emerging AI and NLP capabilities, there is a greater expectation for
                    chatbots to
                    internalise human psychology and process social intelligence. To create this personable experience,
                    we built
                    'Emma' with personality.</h3>

                <h2>Here’s some food for thought –</h2>
                <p>Going through the journey of innovation, many companies have found that the key to promoting
                    mainstream adoption
                    is prioritising certain primary features over others.</p>
                <p>In the context of a banking transaction, we must first ascertain what would move the needle for
                    customers to switch
                    to chatbots as their main channel for preliminary enquiries.</p>
                <p>Would the text-savvy millennial generation really expect chatbots to talk like humans in order to get
                    comfortable
                    with a chat interface? Or would they first look for the bot to display an exceptional ability to
                    deliver the
                    right responses with reliable accuracy and consistency?</p>
                <h3 class="quote">Ultimately, an impactful customer journey needs to be accompanied by a certain
                    situational awareness that makes
                    customers feel as though all touchpoints are personalized and designed to address their unique sets
                    of needs
                    and preferences.</h3>
                <p>This is what voice assistants such as Siri, Google Now and Amazon Echo are trying to accomplish over
                    time as they
                    build a wealth of data on their users.</p>
                <p>The success of 'Emma' started off with delivering a coherent and consistent customer experience. In
                    doing so, we
                    tapped into a massive opportunity to connect with a growing segment of text-savvy and tech-savvy
                    customers who
                    trust technology.</p>
                <p>But are we on the right track? We think so. Since its launch, our chatbot application had closed more
                    than S$100million
                    in home loans. With 'Emma', our team can focus on the conversations that matters most – getting the
                    bank a little
                    more action on the home and renovation loans front!</p>
